## App Exercise - Workout Types

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 You fitness tracking app may allow users to track different kinds of workouts. When architecting the app, you may decide to have a `Workout` base class from which other types of workout classes inherit. Below are three classes. `Workout` is the base class with `time` and `distance` properties, and `Run` and `Swim` are subclasses that add more specific properties to the `Workout` class.

 Also provided is a `workouts` array that represents a log of past workouts. You'll use these classes and the array for the exercises below.

Time is represented in seconds, distance is represented in meters, and cadence is represented in steps per minute.
